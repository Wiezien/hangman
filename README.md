# hangman

A hangman game using Python.

The Hangman program randomly selects from a list of secret words (fruit names).
The player gets limited chances to win the game.
When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible.
There are word length + 2 chances. For example, word to be guessed is mango, then user gets 5 + 2 = 7 chances, as mango is a five-letter word.
